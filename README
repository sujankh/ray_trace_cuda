# [WIP] Ray Tracing using CUDA

(Work in Progress)
Final goal of this project is to render realistic looking objects using ray tracing.
I'm using CUDA to parallelize each rays.

## Navigating source
Each branch in this repo incrementally adds new features to the ray tracer, and adds functionality like shading, reflection, material properties, etc.
For example, branch sphere is the initial version where I am writing some framework to render a sphere (it's a 3D sphere but doesn't look like it).


This branch:
 - Write a simple CUDA kernel that returns a pixel
 - The pixels are written to a PPM file
